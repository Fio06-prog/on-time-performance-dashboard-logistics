# Analysis Notes – On-time Performance Dashboard

## KPI Definitions
- **On-time Rate** = Number of on-time events / Total number of events
- Calculated separately for Pickup and Delivery events

## Analytical Approach
- Compared pickup vs delivery events to identify process-level performance differences.
- Analyzed on-time performance by state to detect geographic variability.
- Used aggregated KPIs to provide a high-level operational overview suitable for management.

## Key Assumptions
- The on-time flag accurately represents delivery punctuality.
- All events are weighted equally in KPI calculations.
- Data reflects normal operating conditions for the selected period.

## Limitations
- Analysis covers only one month (January 2022).
- External factors such as weather, traffic congestion, or labor disruptions are not included.
- Results should be interpreted as directional insights rather than long-term trends.

## Business Relevance
These insights support logistics and operations teams in identifying underperforming processes and regions, enabling targeted improvements to increase delivery reliability.
